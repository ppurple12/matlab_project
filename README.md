# Implementing the GRA Algorithm in MATLAB

**Course**: Computational Physics (PHYS-3007)  
**Author**: Evan Wells

## Overview

This project presents an implementation of the **Group Role Assignment (GRA) algorithm** in MATLAB. GRA is a critical component of the Role-Based Collaboration framework, used to assign agents to tasks optimally based on defined evaluation metrics. While the algorithm is often implemented using Python or optimization tools like IBM CPLEX, this project explores its translation into MATLAB to better understand the algorithm's structure and the MATLAB programming environment.

## Objectives

- Gain proficiency in the MATLAB programming environment
- Utilize MATLAB’s built-in libraries and functions
- Translate the GRA algorithm into working MATLAB code
- Explore the real-world applicability of GRA in load balancing and task assignment

## Structure

The project is structured into the following key sections:

1. **Methodology** – Describes the development strategy and derivation of the algorithm’s structure
2. **Implementation** – Details the MATLAB functions created and how they map to GRA logic
3. **Results** – Provides a sample problem and its solution using the implemented code
4. **Conclusion** – Reflects on outcomes, challenges, and learning experiences

## Why MATLAB?

Although MATLAB is not traditionally used for agent-based role assignment, its high-level matrix operations and intuitive visualization tools provided a useful platform for understanding the algorithm at a lower level. The project emphasizes learning through implementation, making it ideal for academic exploration.

## Example Use Case

The GRA algorithm implemented here can be applied to:
- IT ticket distribution among support agents
- Workforce task optimization
- Dynamic team assignment in project planning
